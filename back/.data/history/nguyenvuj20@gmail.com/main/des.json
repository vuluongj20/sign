  "Lore believes that the future of education is in the hand of experience groups. We are here to see more people opening and joining meaningful learning sessions.",
  "There are growing number of activity groups that offer diverse experiences to a variety of people. Participating in small groups can be an enjoyable bonding experience that motivate people to strive for greater achievement. Also, learning that you receive from direct and interactive experience far exceed what you can learn passively by reading books or listening to lectures. Now that it is easy to form and advertise groups with the help of the Internet, it make sense for people to form more groups and accelerate learning with people that share the same interest.",
  "There is, however, a practical bottle-neck for people to dedicate themselves to these groups. At the current stage, the social status of these groups are very low. They are considered as nothing more than mere “hobbies” that are, at best, good for networking. When it comes to the world of profession, saying that “I am in a computer coding group” is not regarded with the same gravity as “I graduated from Stanford as computer science major.” Before asking what the experience was and what they learned from it, people disregard it as something not very serious. In this situation, it becomes practically difficult for people to dedicate their time to activities that are considered as fruitless from the eyes of the many.",
  "We want to have more people create and participate in these learning groups. To realize this vision, Lore will develop a system that can fairly assess the quality of experience through peer-to-peer validation. The system will, above all, show individuals’ level of growth based on their participation. In addition, it will provide the reputation for groups based on people’s level of happiness. All in all, these results will present socially reputable record that proves how a good experience can mean more than just “having a good time”. We are looking for people who empathize with our vision. For building a community where people share quality experience, Lore should an interesting proposition. Especially, we would like to keep in close contact with session providers to understand what are more specified difficulties you are facing. After understanding, we would like to develop our system around your specific needs so that it will be beneficial to your purpose. Your success is the foundational step to our vision. When more groups succeed in providing good sessions, that is when the social norm regarding these groups will start to change."
